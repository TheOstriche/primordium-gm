# Primordium GM Tool

A laptop web app for running combat in **Primordium 2.0**, an original tabletop RPG designed and run by the owner of this project. It is the GM's companion to the player phone app, which lives beside it in `../sheet/` in the same repository (see the top-level `CLAUDE.md`).

## Decisions already made
- **Platform:** a static web app (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, no build step required) that runs locally by opening it, and is published with **GitHub Pages** like the player app.
- **Laptop first:** designed for a laptop screen with mouse and keyboard; it does not need to work on phones.
- **Players are entered manually** in the GM tool (name, HP, armor, the six stats, Speed for movement). No import from the player app.
- **Grid:** a plain grid, with an **optional map image** the GM can upload underneath it. 1 square = 1M.
- **Saving:** everything is saved locally in the browser (encounters, players, map images). IndexedDB suits map images; include export and import of a backup file.
- **Rules** follow `docs/rules.md` exactly. When something is unclear, ask the owner rather than inventing a rule.

## Features (build in this order)
1. **Encounter setup:** a party roster (players entered manually and reused between sessions) and an enemy picker using all creatures in `data/npc-data.js`, searchable and filterable by family, level, and role, with quantity. Show the encounter's total XP and a difficulty estimate.
2. **Grid map:** adjustable size; optional uploaded map image under the grid; drag tokens for players and enemies; size-correct footprints (Large 2 squares, Huge 2x2, Massive 3x3); distance measuring in meters; show a selected token's movement range (5 + Speed).
3. **Initiative and phases:** enemies get 5 + Perception, players' rolls are typed in, ties per the rules, a turn order list with the active combatant highlighted, a phase counter, and Bosses taking two turns per phase.
4. **Enemy turns:** a button rolls the D20 tactics table, chooses an ability respecting cooldowns and the drop-a-rarity rule, rolls its damage dice from the parsed `attack` data (strikes, dice, sides, flat, AP), and lets the GM pick a target. Damage applies per strike after the target's armor and AP. Humanoids show their combat skill text, and the GM types in damage instead.
5. **HP and effects on every token:** HP with quick damage and heal, armor, stacks (with end-of-phase stack damage and recovery rolls), conditions, temporary effects, and death clocks for downed players.
6. **Ending combat:** totals XP per player and clears combat-only effects.
7. **Data browser:** a quick lookup for skills (every tier's abilities and perks from `primordium-data.js`) and enemies (full stat blocks from `npc-data.js`, plus custom creatures), searchable and filterable.
8. **Custom creature builder:** create, edit, and delete new NPC types (including Bosses) saved locally and included in the backup file. Same shape as `npc-data.js` entries. Use `data/scaling.json` to suggest HP, armor, and damage for the chosen role, level, and armor class, and flag stats far off budget. Custom creatures appear in the enemy picker and data browser.

## Status (2026-10-08)
All eight features are built. Tabs: Encounter, Combat (grid map and combat in one screen), Reference, NPC types, Save. Code layout: `js/rules.js` (scaling math), `js/combat-engine.js` (combat rules), and `js/skills.js` (humanoid skill abilities) hold no screen code and are checked by `node tools/test-rules.js` and `node tools/test-combat.js`; each tab has its own file in `js/`.

### Added 2026-10-09 (owner request)
- **Allies:** friendly NPCs (summons, guides, local help) are added to an encounter's party (`enc.allies`, same shape as `enemies`) and fight as combatants of kind `ally` on the players' side. The NPC picker switches between adding to Enemies or Allies; the combat bar's "Add NPC" adds either mid-fight.
- **NPC types tab** (was Creatures): the campaign's own NPC types. The built-in list (`data/npc-data.js`) holds game-wide changes.
- **Party bulk changes:** ticked players can have their level set, raised by one, or be removed together.
- **Import from the character sheet:** the sheet's backup file (`{ id: character }`) is read with `../shared/character-rules.js`, the same code the sheet uses, so HP (maximum), armor (total), and stats match the sheet. Imported players keep a `sheetId`; importing again updates them.
- **Humanoid skill attacks:** each humanoid token picks its skill (and path) from the options its stat block allows. Its abilities come from that skill in the Skill Guide up to its tier and the best rarity its tactics can roll; Roll tactics picks among the Standard ones. Strike dice are read from the ability text when possible; otherwise the GM types damage ("Type damage instead" works for any NPC). Custom humanoid NPC types can store a default `skillSetup`.

## Combat screen principles (owner feedback, 2026-10-08)
- Players run their own characters. The GM tool only tracks their HP (and downed/death clock), position, and what it needs for movement and initiative (Speed, Perception, armor, level). Do not add player stacks, conditions, or attack tools.
- Enemy attacks are one flow: pick an ability (or Roll tactics), pick the target (list or click its token), roll, set each target's defense, confirm.
- Prefer fewer, smaller controls over more options.

## Open questions and working assumptions
- **Humanoid damage modifier (please confirm):** read as damage stat × (½ per D4 or D6, 1 per D8 to D12, 2 per D20) for each die, plus the weapon tier on the first strike of an attack. A failed strike (every die a 1) deals 0. This reading reproduces the scaling workbook's Tier 0 benchmark (8.33 vs 8.32); a flat +½ per die does not. Fractions round down per strike.
- **Humanoid basic attacks:** on a path, the path's Tier 1 basic attack replaces the Tier 0 one. The "Base Tier 3 upgraded basic attack" in stat blocks has no separate entry in the Skill Guide data, so the Tier 0 attack is used.
- **Allies:** initiative 5 + Perception like other NPCs; ties go players, then allies, then enemies. They are not counted in the difficulty estimate and take no XP share. They are defeated at 0 HP (no death clock), and act in the players' surprise phase.
- **Quick and Defensive enemy abilities:** the NPC data does not mark ability type yet. Until it does, treat every enemy ability as a Standard ability (rolled on the tactics table). Abilities accept an optional `type` field (the creature builder sets it).
- The owner's rulings (diagonals, Boss turns, recovery, rounding, defeat at 0 HP, damage order, cooldowns, Boss budgets, race stat order) are in `docs/rules.md` under "GM rulings".
- Data note: some arc attacks are flagged `area` and others are not (the Boss "180 degree arc" attacks and Forge Lord's Flame Thrower are not).

## Data files
- `data/npc-data.js` sets `window.PRIMORDIUM_NPCS`: 97 creatures with role, level, tactics, HP, armor, size, stats, XP, attributes, description, and abilities. Each ability has a name, rarity, optional cooldown (phases, or "combat" for once per combat), its text, and where it is a damaging strike an `attack` object (`strikes`, `dice`, `sides`, `flat`, optional `ap`, `area`, `ignoreArmor`). Humanoids have `humanoid: true` and a `combatSkill` text instead of abilities. Bosses have `turnsPerPhase: 2`. Slimes and bonded mimics have no HP (`specialHp` explains their rule).
- `data/scaling.json` and `docs/scaling.md`: player benchmarks per power step, role and armor-class budgets, and the encounter difficulty formula (section 8 of `scaling.md`, which supersedes the short difficulty note in `rules.md`). Because the app opens without a server, load this data as a `.js` file that sets a global (like the other data files), kept in sync with the JSON.
- `../shared/primordium-data.js` sets `window.PRIMORDIUM_DATA`: every skill (with each tier's abilities and perks), races, and background traits. Shared with the player app: it is the one copy both apps load, so edit it there only.

## Style
- The owner's guides use Times New Roman with a classic printed-rulebook feel. A dark, readable theme with a serif for headings suits the game; keep it clean and uncluttered for use mid-session.
- Write all text in plain language. Name things the way the guides do (Phase, Tactics, Standard, Elite, stacks, and so on).

## Working with the owner
- They are the game's designer and GM, not a programmer. Explain choices simply, and give clear steps for running the app locally and publishing it to GitHub Pages.
- Build in small, working steps, showing each feature before moving to the next.
